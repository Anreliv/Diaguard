    Diaguard has now two distinct themes: Light, as we know it, and the all-new, more eye-friendly Dark.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    The theme may be changed at any time via the app settings and may adjust itself to the current time of day.
    The system-based night mode, introduced with Android 9, is supported as well.
